# --- BASH INTERPRETER FENCE (go-to-k/cdkd#2402) ------------------------------
# Running this SUITE under bash 3.2 did NOT run the HOOK under it. The hook is
# `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, which resolves through PATH and finds whatever bash is
# first there -- the 5.x on a dev Mac -- so running this SUITE under 3.2 would
# still have exercised a 5.x SUBJECT.
#
# TWO SEPARATE GAPS, and this shim closes only the second. `scripts/run-hook-tests.sh`
# runs each harness under ONE bash -- it has no per-shell loop and exports no
# HOOK_BASH, unlike cdkd's `run-tests.sh` -- so nothing here ran under 3.2 at
# all. Taking the 3.2 tally is therefore an explicit invocation for now:
#
#   HOOK_BASH=/bin/bash /bin/bash .claude/hooks/branch-gate.test.sh
#
# The interpreter is an explicit symlink at the FRONT of PATH, the shape
# cdk-local's `gate-command-recognition.test.sh` already uses. Default
# `/bin/bash`; `HOOK_BASH=/opt/homebrew/bin/bash` takes the 5.x tally. An
# explicitly set HOOK_BASH that is not executable is FATAL rather than a silent
# fall-back: a typo'd override that quietly ran the default would report the
# version it did not run.
#
# PROVEN TO REACH THE HOOK, not merely to be exported. With `;;&` (a bash-4
# `case` terminator, a PARSE error under 3.2 and valid syntax under 5.x)
# injected into the hook's detached-HEAD arm, this suite reports
# 40 pass / 17 fail under `HOOK_BASH=/bin/bash` and 57 pass / 0 fail under
# `HOOK_BASH=/opt/homebrew/bin/bash` -- same suite, same mutant, only the
# interpreter differs. A shim that did not reach the subject would print the
# same tally twice.
#
# PATH keeps its existing entries after the shim rather than being replaced with
# `/usr/bin:/bin`: the hook needs `jq`, which is not in either on every machine.
if [ -n "${HOOK_BASH:-}" ]; then
  # RESOLVE A BARE NAME BEFORE TESTING IT. `-x` does no PATH lookup, so testing
  # the raw value FATALs on a perfectly good interpreter whenever HOOK_BASH is a
  # bare word rather than a path -- and `HOOK_BASH=bash` is the obvious spelling
  # for "whatever PATH gives", which is the shape the header above invites.
  #
  # THE JUSTIFICATION THAT USED TO STAND HERE NAMED A FILE THIS REPO DOES NOT
  # HAVE. It said `run-tests.sh` loops over the candidates and exports
  # `HOOK_BASH="$shell"`; that is true of CDKD's `.claude/hooks/run-tests.sh`,
  # which is where this guard was first needed and where it was measured (the
  # first shape of this block failed the whole 5.x pass with
  # `FATAL - HOOK_BASH is not an executable: bash` while the 3.2 pass, an
  # absolute `/bin/bash`, sailed through -- half the matrix gone, reported as a
  # FAIL rather than as silence, which is the only reason it was caught).
  #
  # In THIS repo the runner is `scripts/run-hook-tests.sh`, which runs each
  # harness under ONE `bash` and exports no HOOK_BASH -- as the header of this
  # file already says, so the two paragraphs used to contradict each other.
  # Nothing here hands this file a bare word on its own, so the guard covers the
  # documented MANUAL invocation instead and the comment now says which. The
  # `ln -sf` below needs an absolute target anyway.

# --- THE REMEDY MUST BE A COMMAND GIT ACCEPTS (go-to-k/cdkd#2402 review) ------
#
# The arm above blocks correctly and, before this round, printed
# `git -C <main> switch main` unconditionally. A conflicted rebase is one of the
# ways a MAIN checkout reaches a detached HEAD -- and `git pull` on `main` in the
# main checkout is this repo's own mandated post-merge sync, so the route is a
# documented one. Measured on git 2.53, mid-rebase in the main checkout:
#
#   git commit -m resolve   ->  rc=2 (correct)
#   the remedy it printed   ->  git -C <main> switch main
#   what git answers        ->  fatal: cannot switch branch while rebasing
#
# A gate that refuses correctly and then names an impossible command is worse
# than one that does not refuse, because the reader has nowhere to go. The block
# stays; the remedy now follows the operation.
#
# EVERY REMEDY BELOW WAS RUN, not just read: each `--abort` / `bisect reset` the
# gate printed was executed verbatim against the fixture and exited 0 (rebase,
# rebase -i, rebase --apply, am, cherry-pick, merge, revert, bisect).
#
# WHAT EACH ROW HOLDS DOWN, measured by mutating the hook and re-running this
# suite. TWO numbers per mutation, `<in this block> / <whole suite>`, because
# the resulting-HEAD block below shares these rows' subject and dies with them
# (cdkd numbers; the siblings differ only in the pre-existing case count):
#
#   never detect an operation                -> 7 / 15 (the six op rows + bisect)
#   report every operation as a `rebase`     -> 5 / 10 (am, cherry-pick, merge, revert, bisect)
#   drop the `applying` sentinel             -> 1 / 2  (am, and only am)
#   `<target_dir>/.git` for the git dir      -> 1 / 1  (the mid-rebase SUBDIR row)
#   always print the operation wording       -> 1 / 1  (the NOTHING-in-progress row)
#
# The one row below with no mutation against it is labelled a CONTROL where it
# stands, rather than left looking like a fence.

# --- THE REMEDY'S RESULTING HEAD (go-to-k/cdkd#2402 review round 3) -----------
#
# The block above asserts the remedy TEXT, and its header recorded that every
# printed remedy had been RUN and exited 0. Both were true and the message was
# still wrong: it promised `--abort` would "abandon it and re-attach", which
# happens in exactly one of the six operations. Measured on git 2.53, each
# printed remedy run verbatim against a detached MAIN checkout, HEAD read
# afterwards -- every one rc=0:
#
#   cherry-pick --abort   before DETACHED   after DETACHED
#   revert      --abort   before DETACHED   after DETACHED
#   merge       --abort   before DETACHED   after DETACHED
#   am          --abort   before DETACHED   after DETACHED
#   rebase      --abort   before DETACHED   after main       (started FROM main)
#   rebase      --abort   before DETACHED   after DETACHED   (started detached)
#   bisect reset          before DETACHED   after main
#
# EXIT STATUS WAS THE WRONG OBSERVABLE. Nine remedies exiting 0 is exactly what
# a message that leaves the user one step short also looks like, and no row here
# asserted the right thing, which is how the wording survived the round that
# checked all nine. The rows below RUN the printed command and assert where HEAD
# lands, beside the sentence the message claims about it -- so the claim and the
# outcome are pinned to each other and cannot drift apart again.
#
# WHAT EACH ROW HOLDS DOWN, measured by mutating the hook and re-running this
# suite (cdkd numbers; the siblings differ only in the pre-existing case count):
#
#   restore `# to abandon it and re-attach`, drop the conditional -> 7 of the 8.
#     Every operation row. The BISECT row SURVIVES, and that is the honest
#     number rather than the one predicted: `bisect reset` is a separate arm
#     with its own claim, which that mutation does not touch.
#   force `reattach_to=""`, never reading `head-name`             -> 2.
#     The two rebase-started-FROM-a-branch rows, one per backend.
#   force `reattach_to="main"` whenever a rebase is in progress   -> 1.
#     The rebase-started-DETACHED row, and only it.
#   `rebase-apply` branch of the sentinel set to `am`             -> 1.
#     The `rebase --apply` row -- the branch the `am`-direction row above
#     cannot see, and the one whose wrong answer is silent.
#
# All four tallies are identical in cdk-local and cdk-real-drift (7 / 2 / 1 / 1),
# measured the same way.
#
# The fixture is `op_repo` again, left on `main` by the block above. Each row
# builds its own state; running the printed remedy IS the assertion, and the
# teardown is a separate, explicit step -- see `op_reset` immediately below for
# why it cannot be the remedy itself.

# EACH ROW TEARS DOWN EXPLICITLY rather than relying on "the printed remedy
# cleaned up". The remedy IS the assertion here, so a mutant that stops printing
# one leaves the fixture MID-OPERATION and every row after it then fails for a
# reason that is not its own. Measured before this helper existed: dropping the
# `applying` sentinel red-lined the `am` row (correctly) and then cherry-pick,
# revert, merge and bisect (cascade) -- 6 rows for a defect that touches 1. A
# tally that cannot be attributed to a row is not a fence, it is noise.
#
# It also VERIFIES that it cleaned up, because `git am` and `git rebase --apply`
# SHARE `.git/rebase-apply`: if an abort leaves that directory behind, the next
# `git am` refuses to start ("previous rebase directory ... still exists") and
# the row that follows measures the RESIDUE instead of its own operation. That
# is not hypothetical -- it is how this suite went green on git 2.53 locally and
# red on the CI runner's older git, where the printed `am --abort` exited 128
# against a rebase-apply directory no am session owned. A fixture that cannot
# assert its own precondition reports the wrong defect.
