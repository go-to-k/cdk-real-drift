# _command-match.sh — shared command matching for the PreToolUse gate hooks.
# SOURCED, never executed: `. "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/_command-match.sh"`.
#
# WHY (go-to-k/cdk-real-drift#1803): every gate used to decide whether it applied
# with a LINE-START-anchored regex tolerating at most one leading `cd <path> &&`,
# so a gated verb anywhere else was invisible and the command ran UNGATED —
# `git add -A && git commit`, `cd <wt>; git commit`, `(cd <wt> && git commit)`,
# `GIT_EDITOR=true git commit`, all measured reaching git.
#
# The model: a Bash tool call is a COMMAND LIST. Segment it, then ask whether any
# SEGMENT is the gated command.
#
# Quoting is handled by NEUTRALISING separators inside quoted spans rather than
# blanking the span. The first version blanked them, which also erased the PATH in
# `cd "<worktree>" && git commit` and `git -C "<path>" commit`, so target-dir
# resolution silently fell back to the payload cwd and the gate passed a commit it
# should have blocked — a regression against the pre-refactor gates, caught in
# review of go-to-k/cdk-local#542. Segments therefore carry their original text;
# only the separator CHARACTERS inside quotes are swapped for placeholders while
# splitting, and swapped back afterwards. A verb inside a string still does not
# match, because the per-verb regexes are anchored at the segment START.

# Placeholders for separators that live inside quoted spans (never in real input).

# One awk pass: join `\`-continuations, blank heredoc BODIES, neutralise
# separators inside quotes, and turn every real separator into a newline. Command
# substitutions (`$(...)` and backticks) become separators too — the text inside
# one RUNS, so `echo "$(git commit -m x)"` is a commit.
